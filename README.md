## Smart Home Data 

I began my interest with smart home applications of a homelab. My goal was to aggregate data generated from within my own house and layer psychological principles to reach a greater understanding of some human behavior or cognition. After spending the summer reading about the implications of smart home technology in psychological research and building my own smart home \(with the intent of generating data for my own case study\), I have come to a greater understanding of this evolving technology's role in our daily lives, mental health, and medical needs.

## Limitations

Before I discuss my findings, it is important to understand and respect the limitations of smart home technology for varying use cases. I live with three roommates, so when I started planning the technology to integrate into the house, I had to keep the privacy of my roommates in mind.
